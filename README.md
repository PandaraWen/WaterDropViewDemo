And the origin design is from designer Vadim Gromov, here is [Gromov's dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1904130-Fluid-Drop-Loading). The original design is as follows:

## How to use the demo?

The main functions are implemented in the file `WaterDropView.m` inside. You can also see some interesting things in another file `ViewController.m`.

If you want to use the effect in your own code, you can do the following (suppose you add the following code in a controller.):
```Objective-c
WaterDropView *waterDropView = [[WaterDropView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
[self.view addSubview:waterDropView];
[waterDropView play];
```
